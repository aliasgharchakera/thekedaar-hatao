\section*{Introduction}

Thekedaar hatao is an application that aims to ease the process of building
your dream home. It provides the users with features that makes the building
process smoother and easier overall for the user of the application. The
calculator on the application, will provide you with an estimated amount of
cement, cinder blocks, sand, and other such raw materials that are essential
while building your house. In addition, the application will help cater the
dreamers by having a forum where people can communicate about the problems that
have arisen and how they tackled them. Advice threads and asking for help will
be carried out on the forum. Since you can never be sure of how much material
you exactly need, there is always a (+ or -)5\% chance of having extra
material, you can also sell this to other users on the app through a buy and
sell section. For individuals wanting to have a communication privately, the
application will also provide an opportunity to privately chat with someone
registered on the application.

\section*{Use Cases}

\subsubsection*{Explanation}

There are two actors in our class diagram. Our primary actor in the class
diagram is the user of the application. The admins of the application that will
manage the application will be the secondary actors of the application. The
users will be concerned with the five features of the application that are;

\begin{itemize}
      \item Login and/or Signup
      \item Raw Material Calculator
      \item Forum
      \item Private chat
      \item Marketplace
\end{itemize}

The user will first sign up to the application, if the user is already
registered to the application, he/she will login to the application. The user
will also use raw material calculator in which one can input the amount of land
in sq/ft and get an estimation on how much raw material might be needed. In
addition, they will also be concerned with the marketplace. The users will be
divided into two types in the marketplace. The vendors that will sell the raw
material, and the consumers that will buy the raw material. The forum and the
chat will be administered by the admins as to stop anyone from misbehaving on
the public forums. The user will also have to set their profile and will have
to verify.
